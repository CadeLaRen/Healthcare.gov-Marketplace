What This Is
------------

This repository served as an unofficial bug tracker and pull request target for fixes
to [healthcare.gov/marketplace](https://healthcare.gov/marketplace/global/en_US/registration),
the latest boondoggle from HHS & CGI Federal.

This repository attempts to be a working clone of the marketplace. You should be able to run this
on a local web server and access healthcare.gov in the same way.


What This Isn't
---------------

This is not an *official* repository. For all we know, nobody is listening.

I have created this in hopes that there are some concerned programmers at CGI Federal who want to see
the project succeed. Sourcing fixes from the users of healthcare.gov is one way to achieve that goal.

See [the pull request](https://github.com/CMSgov/healthcare.gov/pull/31) that started this idea.
